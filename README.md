This project is a study about UX/UI design and a test to my recently knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I've learned a lot of new tricks adding details to the interface, like music system and draging feature on windows.

The Stardew Valley theme is an humble tribute to a game that make so many people happy every day and easily became one of my favorite games.
